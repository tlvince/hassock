# hassock

> Authentication middleware for CouchDB

Sits in between a client and CouchDB to manage (regular) user account creation.
Allows you to keep your CouchDB admin account credentials out of your client
code, whilst making use of Couch's user account functionality. Works best with
sign up forms.

## Usage

Server:

```shell
DB_URL=https://my.couchdb.example.com \
DB_USERNAME=user \
DB_PASSWORD=pass \
USER_ROLES=posts,comments \
USER_GROUP=group \
npm start
```

Client:

```shell
curl -X PUT localhost:3000/users/alice \
  -H "Content-Type application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "alice", "group": "author"}'
```

CouchDB:

```shell
curl localhost:5984/_users/org.couchdb.user%3Aalice
```

```json
{
  "_id": "org.couchdb.user:alice",
  "_rev": "1-68ab0a84d7f8ef771a0e1d4ee49e8f05",
  "password_scheme": "pbkdf2",
  "iterations": 10,
  "name": "alice",
  "roles": [
    "posts",
    "comments",
    "group/author"
  ],
  "type": "user",
  "derived_key": "10f4676307c8c1777ebdaedcc0797eae8ba7a464",
  "salt": "99c4d3304c500c73378c56dca94d605c"
}
```
